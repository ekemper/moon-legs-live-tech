# 08 — Practice Routine and Exercises

This doc covers **how to structure practice** and **which exercises** support your technique. A clear routine makes progress more reliable and helps you avoid injury and burnout.

## Principles

- **Consistency over length:** Short daily practice (e.g. 15–20 minutes) beats rare long sessions.
- **Warm-up first:** Start with easy, slow work (posture check, pentascales, simple scales) before harder pieces or fast exercises.
- **Order matters:** Posture → relaxation → five-finger → scales → articulation → hand independence. Don’t skip the basics.
- **Stop if it hurts:** Pain, numbness, or lasting soreness means stop and rest. Check posture and technique; see a doctor if it continues.

## Suggested daily structure (beginner)

**Total time:** About 15–25 minutes to start. Adjust as you add repertoire.

| Step | What to do | Time (approx.) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1. **Setup** | Check bench height, distance, posture ([01](01-posture-and-setup.md)). | 1 min |
| 2. **Warm-up** | Gentle, slow playing: pentascales or one-octave C major, relaxed hand ([04](04-five-finger-position-and-pentascales.md), [05](05-scales-and-thumb-technique.md)). | 3–5 min |
| 3. **Technique** | Scales (one or two keys), or articulation work ([06](06-articulation-legato-and-staccato.md)), or hand-independence exercises ([07](07-hand-independence.md)). Rotate so you don’t do the same thing every day. | 5–8 min |
| 4. **Repertoire / pieces** | Work on one or two pieces or exercises from a method book. Hands separate if needed; then together. | 5–10 min |
| 5. **Cool-down (optional)** | Slow pentascale or scale, or a simple piece you know well. End relaxed. | 2–3 min |

You can shorten or extend each block; the idea is: **setup → warm-up → technique → pieces → optional cool-down**.

## Warm-up ideas

- **Pentascales:** C, G, F major; both hands; legato, then staccato.
- **C major scale:** One octave, each hand; slow and even.
- **Arm drop:** A few single notes with arm weight ([03](03-relaxation-and-arm-weight.md)) to remind the body to stay relaxed.

Keep the warm-up **easy and slow**. The goal is to wake up the hands and body, not to push speed or difficulty.

## Technique exercises: what to add when

**Early (weeks 1–4):**

- Pentascales (C, G, F major); one hand at a time, then together.
- Single-note legato and staccato on a pentascale.

**Next (weeks 4–8):**

- One-octave C major scale; then G major; then F major.
- Legato and staccato on one-octave scales.
- Simple hand-independence: one hand loud, one quiet on a scale or pentascale.

**Later (months 2–3+):**

- More scales (D, A, E major; natural minor).
- Hand independence: legato vs staccato per hand; simple canons.
- Optional: **Hanon** (e.g. Exercises 1–5) or **Czerny** (e.g. Op. 599) at a slow tempo, with a teacher’s guidance.

## Hanon and Czerny (optional)

- **Hanon (*The Virtuoso Pianist*):** Short, repetitive finger patterns (e.g. Exercises 1–20) to build evenness and finger independence. Often practiced in C first, then transposed. Use **slow tempo** and **relaxed hand**; avoid tension. A teacher can help you avoid bad habits.
- **Czerny (e.g. Op. 599):** Short études that combine finger patterns with rhythm and reading. Good after you’re comfortable with scales and basic articulation.

**Important:** Don’t use these as a substitute for posture, relaxation, and scales. They work best when you already have a good setup and basic technique.

## What to practice on a busy day

If you have very little time:

1. **Posture check** (1 min).
2. **One or two pentascales** or **C major scale** (2–3 min), slow and relaxed.
3. **One short section** of a piece (2–3 min).

Even 5–10 minutes keeps the habit and the body used to the instrument.

---

## Tracking progress (optional)

- **Practice log:** Note what you did each day (e.g. “C major scale RH/LH; legato/staccato; Ex. 7 hand independence”). You’ll see patterns and progress.
- **Goals:** Set small goals (e.g. “C major scale hands together, 4 times in a row without a mistake”) and tick them off when done.
- **Recording:** Occasionally record a scale or short piece and listen for evenness, tension, or uneven articulation.

---

## Quick reference

- **Order:** Setup → warm-up → technique → pieces → optional cool-down.
- **Warm-up:** Easy pentascales or scales; slow and relaxed.
- **Technique:** Build from pentascales → scales → articulation → hand independence; add Hanon/Czerny later if desired.
- **Consistency:** Short daily practice; stop if there’s pain.
- **Teacher:** If you can, get a teacher to check posture, technique, and exercise choice.
