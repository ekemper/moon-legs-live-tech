# Piano Technique: A Beginner’s Guide

A series of documents on **hand technique**, **posture**, and **practice** for piano beginners. Each doc focuses on one area and includes exercises and how to learn it.

---

## How to use this series

- **Order:** Work through the docs in number order. Each builds on the last.
- **Pace:** Don’t rush. Spend at least a week on each topic (or more) until it feels comfortable.
- **Practice:** Do the exercises daily. Short, consistent practice beats long, rare sessions.
- **Teacher:** If you can, work with a teacher to check posture and technique and avoid injury.

## Suggested learning path

1. **Weeks 1–2:** [01 Posture and setup](01-posture-and-setup.md) + [02 Hand position](02-hand-position.md).  
   Get your body and hands in a good place before adding difficulty.

2. **Weeks 2–3:** [03 Relaxation and arm weight](03-relaxation-and-arm-weight.md).  
   Learn to play without tension and use arm weight.

3. **Weeks 3–4:** [04 Five-finger position and pentascales](04-five-finger-position-and-pentascales.md).  
   Build your first technical foundation without moving the hand.

4. **Weeks 4–6:** [05 Scales and thumb technique](05-scales-and-thumb-technique.md).  
   Add C major (and later G major) with thumb under and finger crossing.

5. **Weeks 6–8:** [06 Articulation](06-articulation-legato-and-staccato.md) + [07 Hand independence](07-hand-independence.md).  
   Refine sound and coordination between hands.

6. **Ongoing:** [08 Practice routine](08-practice-routine-and-exercises.md).  
   Use this to structure daily practice and add exercises (e.g. Hanon, Czerny) as you progress.

## Core principles (summary)

- **Posture first:** Bench height and distance so forearms are roughly level and relaxed.
- **Relaxed hands:** Slight curve, no gripping; let arm weight do the work.
- **Build in order:** Five-finger position → pentascales → scales → articulation → hand independence.
- **Avoid injury:** No keybedding (pressing into the keybed), no extreme stretching; warm up and stop if you feel pain.
- **Consistency:** Short daily practice is better than rare long sessions.

Start with [01 Posture and setup](01-posture-and-setup.md).
