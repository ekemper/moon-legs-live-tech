# 01 — Posture and Setup

Good posture and setup make everything else easier: less tension, better sound, and fewer injuries. Do this before worrying about finger exercises.

## Why it matters

- **Prevents injury:** Bad posture and height cause tension in shoulders, back, wrists, and hands. That can lead to repetitive strain (e.g. tendinitis, carpal tunnel).
- **Better control:** When your body is balanced, arm weight can flow to the keys instead of being held in your muscles.
- **Endurance:** You can practice longer without pain or fatigue.

## Bench height

**Goal:** When your fingers rest on the keys, your **forearms are roughly parallel to the floor** (or very slightly sloping down toward the keyboard).

- **Too low:** Wrists bend up, shoulders hunch, arms carry weight. Tiring and risky.
- **Too high:** Wrists bend down, fingers hit keys at a bad angle. Stiff and tense.

**What to do:**

1. Sit on the bench and place your hands on the keys in a relaxed, natural position.
2. Look at your forearms. They should be close to horizontal.
3. Adjust the bench (or use a cushion) until you get there. If the bench doesn’t adjust, mark what height you need and find a solution (different bench, risers, etc.).

## Distance from the keyboard

**Goal:** Elbows slightly in front of your torso, **not directly under your shoulders**. You should be able to reach the full range of the keyboard without leaning or stretching.

- Sit so you can reach the **middle of the keyboard** (around middle C / C4) with your arms relaxed.
- You should be able to move to high and low notes by shifting your whole body or arms, not by straining at the shoulder.

**Check:** Reach with each hand to the highest and lowest keys you’ll use. You should get there without locking your shoulder or leaning heavily to one side.

## Sitting position

- **Spine:** Sit tall but relaxed. Imagine a string pulling the top of your head up; don’t stiffen your neck or shoulders.
- **Feet:** Flat on the floor (or on a footrest if the bench is high). This stabilizes your body so your arms are free.
- **Bench:** Sit toward the **front half** of the bench, not slumped against the back. This keeps your back active and your arms able to move.
- **Centering:** Sit so your **nose or belly button** lines up with middle C (or the center of your keyboard). That gives both hands equal access.

## Exercises (no playing yet)

Do these at the piano to lock in the setup:

1. **Height check**  
   Rest your hands on the keys. Look at your forearms. Adjust the bench until they’re roughly level. Repeat every time you sit down until it becomes automatic.

2. **Reach check**  
   With hands still on the keys, slowly move each hand to the far left and far right of your range. Notice if you have to lean or tense. Adjust distance from the keyboard so you can reach comfortably.

3. **Relax check**  
   Shake out your arms and shoulders. Sit again with feet flat, spine tall. Rest your hands on the keys. Notice if any part of your back, shoulders, or arms is holding tension. Breathe and let those areas soften.
