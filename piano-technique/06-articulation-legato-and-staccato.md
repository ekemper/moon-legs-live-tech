# 06 — Articulation: Legato and Staccato

**Articulation** is how you connect or separate notes. The two main types for beginners are **legato** (smooth, connected) and **staccato** (short, detached). Learning both gives you control over the character of what you play.

---

## Legato (connected)

**Legato** means the notes sound **smooth and connected**—one note leads into the next without a gap.

**How to play legato:**

- **Overlap:** Keep each key down until the next key is pressed. So: press key 1 → press key 2 (then you can release key 1) → press key 3 (then release key 2), and so on. Like walking: one foot is on the ground before the other leaves.
- **No gap:** There should be no silence between notes; the sound flows from one note to the next.
- **Wrist and arm:** Stay relaxed so the hand can move smoothly from key to key without stiffness.

**In sheet music:** Legato is shown with a **slur** (curved line) over or under a group of notes. Play all notes under one slur in a connected way.

## Staccato (detached)

**Staccato** means the notes are **short and separated**—each note is clearly distinct with space between them.

**How to play staccato:**

- **Press and release:** Play the key and **release it quickly**, as if touching something hot. The note sounds, then you let go so there’s silence before the next note.
- **Short, not harsh:** The note should be clear and short, not banged. Use a quick, light motion rather than punching the key.
- **Wrist:** A small, relaxed wrist motion can help: a slight “bounce” or release after each note, without locking the wrist.

**In sheet music:** Staccato is shown with a **dot** above or below the note head. Play that note short and detached.

## Memory aid

- **Legato** = **L**ong (connected).
- **Staccato** = **S**hort (detached).

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Legato on a pentascale

- **Right hand:** Play the C major pentascale (C–D–E–F–G) **legato**. Hold each key until the next one is down. Go up and down. Repeat 3–5 times.
- **Left hand:** Same pentascale, same way.
- **Focus:** Smooth sound, no gaps; relaxed hand.

### Exercise 2: Staccato on a pentascale

- **Right hand:** Play the same five notes **staccato**. Each note short and separated. Go up and down. Repeat 3–5 times.
- **Left hand:** Same.
- **Focus:** Clear, short notes; no pressing into the keybed; relaxed wrist.

### Exercise 3: Same scale, two articulations

- Play the C major pentascale **once legato** (up and down).
- Then play it **once staccato** (up and down).
- Notice the difference in sound and feel. Repeat with the other hand.

### Exercise 4: Legato then staccato on C major scale (one octave)

- When one-octave C major scale is comfortable, play it **legato** up and down (right hand, then left).
- Then play the same scale **staccato** up and down.
- Keep a steady tempo and even tone in both articulations.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| **Legato:** Releasing too early so there are gaps | Keep each key down until the next key is pressed. |
| **Legato:** Holding keys too long and blurring the line | Release as soon as the next note has sounded. |
| **Staccato:** Playing too loud or harsh | Use a quick, light touch; don’t hit the key. |
| **Staccato:** Not short enough | Release immediately after the note sounds. |

## Why this matters

- **Expression:** Legato and staccato let you shape phrases and create contrast.
- **Repertoire:** Music often mixes legato and staccato; you need both.
- **Hand independence:** Later you’ll play legato in one hand and staccato in the other ([07 Hand independence](07-hand-independence.md)).

---

## Quick reference

- **Legato:** Connected; hold each key until the next is down; no gaps.
- **Staccato:** Short and detached; press and release quickly.
- **Notation:** Slur = legato; dot = staccato.
- **Practice:** Use pentascales and one-octave scales; practice each articulation separately first.
