# 05 — Scales and Thumb Technique

Once you’re comfortable with five-finger position and pentascales, the next step is **full one-octave scales**. That means moving the hand along the keyboard using **thumb under** and **finger over** so you can play more than five notes in a row.

## Why scales

- **Technique:** Scales build evenness, finger independence, and coordination.
- **Theory:** They reinforce key signatures and the layout of the keyboard.
- **Repertoire:** Much of piano music uses scale-like patterns; scale practice makes those passages easier.

## Start with C major

**C major** has no sharps or flats, so the scale is all white keys:  
**C – D – E – F – G – A – B – C**

**Right hand (ascending):**  
1(C) – 2(D) – 3(E) – **1(F)** – 2(G) – 3(A) – 4(B) – 5(C)

The **thumb (1) goes under** the hand to play F so the hand can continue upward. That’s “thumb under.”

**Right hand (descending):**  
5(C) – 4(B) – 3(A) – 2(G) – **1(F)** – 3(E) – 2(D) – 1(C)

Here, after the thumb plays F, the **middle finger (3) crosses over** the thumb to play E. That’s “finger over.”

**Left hand (ascending):**  
5(C) – 4(D) – 3(E) – 2(F) – 1(G) – **2(A)** – 3(B) – 4(C)

In the left hand, the **middle finger (2) crosses over** the thumb after G to play A.

**Left hand (descending):**  
4(C) – 3(B) – 2(A) – **1(G)** – 2(F) – 3(E) – 4(D) – 5(C)

The thumb goes under to play G so the hand can continue downward.

## Thumb under (TU)

- **When:** You need to play the next note “under” the current position (e.g. right hand going up: after 3 on E, thumb plays F).
- **How:** As finger 3 plays E, the thumb moves **under** the hand toward F. The hand shifts slightly so the thumb can play F without stretching. The motion should be **smooth**, not a jerk.
- **Use:** Thumb under is especially useful for **slower**, **legato** scale passages where you want a connected sound.

---

## Finger over (crossing)

- **When:** After the thumb has played, the next finger (2, 3, or 4) “crosses over” the thumb to play the next note (e.g. right hand: after 1 on F, finger 2 or 3 plays G).
- **How:** The hand moves so the crossing finger can reach the next key without the thumb leaving the key too early (in legato) or the hand feeling cramped.
- **Use:** You use finger over every time you continue a scale after a thumb note.

---

## Important for beginners

- **Slow first:** Practice the scale **very slowly** so the thumb-under and finger-over feel smooth and even. Rushing causes bumps and uneven tone.
- **Even tone:** Try to make every note the same volume. The thumb and the crossing finger often stick out; aim for consistency.
- **No tension:** Keep the wrist flexible and the hand relaxed. If the thumb or wrist stiffens, slow down.
- **Both hands:** Practice right hand alone, left hand alone, then hands together. Don’t combine hands until each hand is comfortable.

## C major scale: step-by-step (right hand, one octave up and down)

1. **Ascending:** Play C(1) – D(2) – E(3). Prepare the thumb under the hand, then play F(1) – G(2) – A(3) – B(4) – C(5).
2. **Descending:** Play C(5) – B(4) – A(3) – G(2) – F(1). Cross finger 3 over the thumb to E(3) – D(2) – C(1).
3. **Repeat** several times at a steady, slow tempo. Focus on smooth thumb-under and finger-over.

Do the same process for the **left hand** (one octave lower or in a comfortable range).

---

## What to practice next

**Order that works well:**

1. **C major** (no sharps/flats) — both hands, one octave.
2. **G major** (one sharp: F♯) — same finger pattern as C in each hand.
3. **D major** (two sharps: F♯, C♯).
4. **F major** (one flat: B♭) — thumb on B♭ in right hand; different finger pattern.

Add one new key at a time. Practice it until it feels comfortable before adding the next.

## Thumb under vs thumb over (for later)

- **Thumb under (TU):** Thumb passes under the hand. Best for slow to moderate, legato scales.
- **Thumb over (TO):** The whole hand moves so the thumb doesn’t pass under; the hand “jumps” or shifts. Used in fast scale passages.

As a beginner, focus on **thumb under** and **smooth, even scales**. Thumb over is a refinement for faster playing and can be added later with a teacher.

## Quick reference

- **C major scale:** C D E F G A B C (all white keys).
- **Right hand:** Thumb under after 3 (E→F going up); finger 3 over after thumb (F→E going down).
- **Left hand:** Finger 2 (or 3) over after thumb going up; thumb under going down.
- **Practice:** Slow, even, relaxed; one hand at a time, then together.
