# 02 — Hand Position

Hand position is how you shape your hand and fingers on the keys. A good position is **relaxed and slightly curved**—not flat, not claw-like. It supports clear tone and helps avoid tension and injury.

---

## Why it matters

- **Tone:** Playing with the **tips** of the fingers (and the pad of the thumb) gives better control and a clearer sound than flat fingers.
- **Tension:** Flat or overly curled fingers create unnecessary work for the hand and wrist.
- **Injury:** Gripping or pressing with a rigid hand increases the risk of strain over time.

## Finding a natural hand position

Your natural hand position comes from a **relaxed arm**, not from forcing the hand into a shape.

1. **Off the keyboard:** Let your arm hang from your shoulder. Shake it out so it’s loose.
2. **Bring it to the keys:** Move your arm to the keyboard **without tensing**. Let the hand land on the keys.
3. **Observe:** You should see:
   - A **gentle curve** in the fingers (like holding a small ball or an apple).
   - **Knuckles** roughly in line (not collapsed or sticking up).
   - **Palm** angled slightly back from the keys, not flat on the keybed.

That’s your baseline. When you play, you keep this shape instead of flattening or clawing.

## What to avoid

| Problem | Why it’s bad | Fix |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| **Flat fingers** | Weak tone, key slips, extra tension in the hand | Think “curved”; play with finger tips. |
| **Overly curled (claw)** | Stiff hand, cramped motion, fatigue | Relax; allow a gentle curve, not a fist. |
| **Collapsed knuckles** | No strength, uneven sound | Keep knuckles slightly raised and in line. |
| **Wrist below keys** | Strain, poor alignment | Wrist level with hand, slightly above key level. |

## Finger numbering

Piano uses a standard numbering system:

- **1** = Thumb  
- **2** = Index  
- **3** = Middle  
- **4** = Ring  
- **5** = Pinky  

Same for both hands. You’ll see this in exercises and method books (e.g. “finger 3 on C”).

## Thumb position

The thumb is shorter and plays from the **side** (near the nail), not the tip like the other fingers.

- On the key, the thumb should contact the key with the **outer edge of the pad**, not flat or on the nail.
- Keep the thumb **relaxed**; don’t tuck it stiffly under the palm or push it forward.

## Exercises (on the keys)

Do these slowly. Focus on keeping the same relaxed, slightly curved shape.

1. **Silent keys**  
   Place one hand on five white keys (e.g. C–G). Don’t press yet. Check: gentle curve, knuckles in line, wrist level. Repeat with the other hand.

2. **One note at a time**  
   Press one key with finger 3 (middle). Hold it down. Feel the key with the finger tip; no gripping. Release slowly. Repeat with fingers 2, 4, 5, then 1 (thumb from the side).

3. **Five-note hold**  
   Place fingers 1–5 on C–G (right hand). Press all five keys down gently and hold. Keep the curve and relaxed wrist. Release together. Do the same with the left hand on a different set of five keys (e.g. C–G an octave lower).

## Quick reference

- **Curve:** Gentle, like holding a small ball.
- **Contact:** Finger tips (and thumb from the side).
- **Knuckles:** Slightly up and in line.
- **Wrist:** Level with the hand, not drooping.
- **Avoid:** Flat fingers, claw grip, collapsed knuckles.
