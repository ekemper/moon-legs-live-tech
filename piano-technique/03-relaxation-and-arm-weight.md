# 03 — Relaxation and Arm Weight

Good piano playing uses the **weight of your arm** flowing through a **relaxed wrist** into the keys—not finger-only force. Learning to stay relaxed and use arm weight improves tone and helps prevent injury.

## Why it matters

- **Tone:** Arm weight gives a fuller, more controlled sound than pressing with tense fingers.
- **Injury:** Tension in the wrist and arm is a main cause of problems (e.g. tendinitis, carpal tunnel). Relaxation and proper alignment reduce that risk.
- **Endurance:** Relaxed playing is less tiring; you can practice longer.

## Arm weight vs finger pressing

**Inefficient:** Pushing the keys down mainly with finger muscles. The hand and wrist stiffen, and the arm doesn’t help. This is tiring and can hurt.

**Efficient:** The **arm’s weight** drops through a **flexible wrist** into the fingertips and keys. The fingers guide and articulate; they don’t do all the work. The wrist acts like a bridge that lets weight pass through without getting stuck.

Think of it like walking: your leg weight transfers through your foot; you don’t grip the ground with your toes. At the piano, arm weight transfers through your fingers into the keys.

## Wrist: flexible, not locked

- **Level:** The wrist should be roughly **level with your hand** and **slightly above** the keyboard—not drooping below the keys.
- **Flexible:** It should be able to move slightly as you play (e.g. a small “give” when you play a note), not rigid.
- **Breathing:** Some teachers say the wrist should “breathe”—a tiny, relaxed motion that keeps it from freezing. When the wrist is stiff, weight gets trapped and doesn’t reach the keys.

## What causes tension

- **Bad posture or bench height** (see [01 Posture and setup](01-posture-and-setup.md)).
- **Pressing into the keybed** (keybedding): pushing past the point where the key has sounded and holding pressure. Avoid this; press only to the point of sound, then relax.
- **Extreme stretching** between fingers. Stretch only as much as is comfortable; close the hand again as soon as you can.
- **Playing only with fingers** and not involving the arm. The arm should support and move with the hand.

## Playing from the shoulder

Energy and weight should start from the **shoulder** and flow down:

- **Shoulder** → relaxed, not lifted or pulled back.
- **Upper arm** → hangs naturally, can move side to side and forward as you reach different keys.
- **Forearm** → carries the hand to the right place.
- **Wrist** → stays flexible so weight can pass through.
- **Hand and fingers** → receive the weight and articulate the keys.

You’re not “holding” the arm up with muscle; you’re letting it rest and move as needed.

## Exercises

1. **Arm drop (one key)**  
   Lift your forearm and hand a few inches above one key. Let the arm **fall** so one finger (e.g. 3) hits the key. Don’t push; just release and drop. Notice the sound. Repeat with different fingers. Goal: feel the weight of the arm, not finger punching.

2. **Wrist check**  
   Play a single note. As you play, notice your wrist. Does it give slightly, or is it locked? Try playing the same note again and allow a tiny, relaxed movement in the wrist (no stiffness). Repeat on a few keys.

3. **No keybedding**  
   Play a note and hold it down. Press only until the key is fully down and the note is sounding; then **stop adding pressure**. Don’t push further into the keybed. Release. Do this on several notes. Build the habit of “press to sound, then relax.”

4. **Breathing**  
   Before you play a short phrase, take a breath. Play the phrase while breathing out. Notice if your shoulders or arms tense. If they do, pause, breathe, and play again with less tension.

## Red flags (stop and rest)

- **Pain** in hand, wrist, forearm, or shoulder.
- **Numbness or tingling** in fingers or hand.
- **Lasting soreness** after practice.

If any of these appear, stop playing, rest, and check posture and technique. If it continues, see a doctor or a specialist (e.g. performing arts medicine).

## Quick reference

- **Arm weight** flows through a **relaxed wrist** into the keys.
- **Wrist:** Level with hand, slightly above keys; flexible, not locked.
- **Avoid:** Keybedding, extreme stretching, finger-only pressing.
- **Warm up** before demanding work; stop if you feel pain.
